# Angular Boilerplate

This boilerplate gives you an infrastructure to run and develop Angular apps
using gulp for build processes, jasmine for unit testing, and karma for running
tests.

## Getting Started

`npm install`

`npm start`

## During Development

To restart the server when code changes, use `npm run develop`.

To run the entire test suite (lint and unit tests), use `npm run test`.

To practice test driven development, use `npm run tdd`.

To build the distributed files, use `npm run build`.

## Testing

Source files should be placed in the app directory. Test files should be placed
in the spec directory.
